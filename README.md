# GUIproject
A side project I wrote in summer 2021

This is a basic listing application that allows users to add, delete, or clear entries in a GUI and saves it automatically to a file.
A menu bar allows user to set settings to customize their experience and save their list manually (if they are paranoid).
On start up, the user is allowed to start a new list or resume with the previous save.
