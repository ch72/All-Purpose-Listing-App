# The All-Purpose-Listing-Application

**Functions and Features:**

This is an efficient, modular listing application that makes it extremely easy 
to list out a series of items whether its a shopping list or a list of 
brainstormed ideas. 

The app has two informational columns alongside the event in the date and the 
score. The date is useful for longer term lists, like for logging significant 
events or making small journal entries while the score is useful in comparing 
items in the list, whether its ranking video games or sports players.

The top bar contains extra features. 
File -> Save: App autosaves entries, but scores will only be saved using Save

Edit -> Change Color: Allows background color of list entries to be changed
Edit -> Hide Score: Hides the entire score column
